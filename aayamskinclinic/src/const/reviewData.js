        'Such a humble doctor hard to find in Indore. I had severe acne scars since adolescence. I had also taken treatment for the same from other skin doctors. but couldn`t see any significant difference. But from her clinic i could see difference with only 3 sittings of microneedling. I would highly recommend her.',

        'I had an opportunity to visit Dr. Abhilasha Patidar. This was one of the best clinic in indore city. The clinic was neat and clean. Dr was professional and she knew how to treat the patients. Well behaved and quite modest. In the whole process, Dr explained the causes and what precautions to be taken care to avoid such problems in future. She minutely rechecked to ensure that everything she did was perfect so overall , highly recommended.',
